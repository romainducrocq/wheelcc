[ ] debug bitwise
[ ] in all scripts that dont need macos: early exit:
    - cmake_build: revert to build
    - test/build: revert to build
    - get-dependencies: exit immediately
    - test-memory: exit immediately
    - test-all: skip test-memory
[ ] get-tests for macos assembly
[ ] validate test-preprocessor, test-compiler, test-errors
[ ] maybe, figure out how to use ld + crt ?
